* **Hypothesis 1:** The popular car on LT auto-park is VW, but the german brand cars are not 'dominating'. It is almost half of all cars in LT.
* **Hypothesis 2:** The average age of cars in Vilnius is significantly lower (~14.0 years) than in other regions (~17.5 years), due to a larger proportion of new cars (0-10 years).
